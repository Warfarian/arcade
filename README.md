# Arcade - where games live

This is a practice webpage I built to implement a shopping cart. The webpage is fully responsive across multiple devices using React for the frontend, Vitest for testing, and vanilla CSS for styling.

## Features:
- **RAWG API**: The RAWG-API provides data for the game's info, ensuring dynamic content is fetched.
- **Fallback Content**: In case the API fails, fallback images and content are included to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Fully Responsive**: The webpage adjusts across various device sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **React Implementation**: The shopping cart and page components are built using React.
- **Vitest for Testing**: Ensures the components function correctly with unit tests.
- **Vanilla CSS Styling**: Custom styling without any CSS frameworks, giving full control over design.

## Future Improvements:
- **Full-Stack Application**: The project may evolve into a full-stack application with backend support.
- **Checkout Menu**: The checkout functionality will be implemented in future versions to process user orders.
